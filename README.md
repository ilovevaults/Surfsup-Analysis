# Surfsup-Analysis
## Goals
The goal of this analysis is to take weather data specifically the temperature in Hawaii and determine if the business should keep open or close either their ice cream shop, surf shop, or both. The data used contains weather info all year round from 2010-2017
From the results we can determine whether or not keeping the surf and ice cream shop year round will be sustinable.
## Results
-The average temperature of June is 74 degrees while the average temperature of December is 71 degrees.
-There are some dates in December of each year where the temperature was lower than 70 degrees which may cause some people to not
want any ice cream. This could affect the ice cream part of their business if this pattern continues
### Summary
It is definitely sustainable to keep the shop open during June and during December they should consider closing the ice cream part of their business 
due to the drop in temperature. One query I would recommend using will determine the percepritation in both months since it may affect people 
who want to surf.
